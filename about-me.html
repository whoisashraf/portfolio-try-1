        Hey there! I'm Ashraf, a passionate and skilled junior front-end
        developer on a mission to bring your web projects to life! With six
        months of hands-on experience under my belt, I've honed my skills in
        HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and jQuery. But I don't stop
        thereâ€”I'm always eager to learn and currently mastering the art of
        Alpine.js and Svelte. These cutting-edge technologies have ignited my
        creativity and opened new possibilities to take my creations to the next
        level!

      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Alpine.js:</strong> With Alpine.js, I'm learning to create
        interactive and reactive user interfaces without the need for heavy
        libraries. It enables me to add seamless interactivity to web pages with
        minimal setup and a familiar syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Svelte:</strong> Svelte has been a game-changer for me. Its
        compilation approach shifts the heavy lifting of JavaScript to
        build-time, resulting in incredibly fast and efficient web applications.
        I'm excited about its potential to deliver smoother animations and
        top-notch performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>React:</strong> React has been an indispensable tool in my
        front-end developer toolkit. Its component-based architecture and
        virtual DOM have streamlined my development process, allowing me to
        build complex user interfaces efficiently. With React's reusability and
        easy-to-understand syntax, I've created interactive and dynamic web
        applications that provide seamless user experiences.
